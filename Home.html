      Hey, I’m Nick and welcome to my page!
      <div class="break"></div>
        <div class="itemONE"> I have officialy completed my undergraduate degree at  the <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/" target="_blank" style="color:#2F2FA2;"> University of Western Ontario</a>, graduating with an Honours Specialization in Biochemistry and Chemistry.  I have a particular interest in proteomic, and organometallic chemistry with applications in medicinal fields including prosthetics, drug synthesis, and imaging. </p>
        <br>
        Currently I am working as apart of my NSERC-USRA research grant with Dr. Arghya Paul. I am creating, and characterizing hydrogels comprised of tungsten disulfide decorated with silver nanoparticles. I am also working to measure the rate of hydrogel crosslinking, and simulating DNA tetrahedron drug compatibilities. </p>
         <br><p>  I completed my undergraduate level thesis under <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/chem/people/faculty/constas.html"target="_blank" style="color:#2F2FA2;">Dr. Styliani Consta </a> simulating weak protein-protein interactions using <a href=" http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/"target="_blank" style="color:#2F2FA2;"> NAMD </a> and <a href=" http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/"target="_blank" style="color:#2F2FA2;"> VMD </a> molecular dynamic simulations. </p>
         <br><p> Over the summer if 2022, I worked in the lab of <a href="https://publish.uwo.ca/~konerman/"target="_blank" style="color:#2F2FA2;">Dr. Lars Konermann </a>, investigating solvent attributes in native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Native ESI-MS) using a combination of benchtop experiments and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using<a href="https://www.gromacs.org/" target="_blank"style="color:#2F2FA2;"> GROMACS </a>. I also do some side free-lance work rapid prototyping, designing and fabricating 3D modelled, and printed components built to the clients specifications.  </p>
         <br><p> I love the outdoors, hiking, kayaking, and biking as much as I can in the summer. Recreationally, tennis, volleyball, and soccer are my go-to sports having played the latter two competitively for most of my life. In the winter, I’m a huge downhill skier although recently I’ve starting mixing in some cross-country skiing as well.</p>
        <br><p>Indoors, I’m a strategy game/puzzle fanatic and  tinkerer. I’m also a huge baker/cook who loves making extravagant foods from across the world. The only thing that’s as satisfying as eating a delicious meal is sharing a delicious meal with friends and family that you can take pride in! </p> </div>
