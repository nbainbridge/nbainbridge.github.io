      Hey, I’m Nick and welcome to my page!
      <div class="break"></div>
        <div class="itemONE"> I’m an undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/" target="_blank" style="color:#2F2FA2;"> University of Western Ontario</a>, having just completed my third year of an Honours Specialization in Biochemistry and Chemistry.  I have a particular interest in proteomic, and organometallic chemistry with applications in medicinal fields including prosthetics, drug synthesis, and imaging. </p></div>
        <div class="itemONE"> <p> Currently I'm working in a chemistry lab under <a href="https://publish.uwo.ca/~konerman/"target="_blank" style="color:#2F2FA2;">Dr. Lars Konermann </a>, investigating solvent attributes in native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Native ESI-MS) using a combination of benchtop experiments and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using<a href="https://www.gromacs.org/" target="_blank"style="color:#2F2FA2;"> GROMACS </a>. I also do some side free-lance work rapid prototyping, designing and fabricating 3D modelled, and printed components built to the clients specifications.  </p> </div>
        <div class="itemONE"> <p> I love the outdoors, hiking, kayaking, and biking as much as I can in the summer. Recreationally, tennis, volleyball, and soccer are my go-to sports having played the latter two competitively for most of my life. In the winter, I’m a huge downhill skier although recently I’ve starting mixing in some cross-country skiing as well.</p> </div>
        <div class="itemONE"> <p>Indoors, I’m a strategy game/puzzle fanatic and  tinkerer. I’m also a huge baker/cook who loves making extravagant foods from across the world. The only thing that’s as satisfying as eating a delicious meal is sharing a delicious meal with friends and family that you can take pride in! </p> </div>
